The youtube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aA4tfBGY6jY got me started 
working on this project. It uses H2 in memory database for storing data from the 
API-NBA API (https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-nba). This API will be used
to retrieve all teams, players, division related information and will be 
persisted to a MySQL DB. H2 database is being used just to get started. As I will
progress with the youtube video, I will be checking in more of the changes to 
this project.
